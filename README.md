This was a data exercise that I recieved from Deloitte as part of the Interview process.

I was welcome to use any tools of my choice and I chose to use Python. 
The goal was to clean the data and organize it to answer 4 questions any way that I chose.
My analysis was reported in a PowerPoint presentation and sent to a recruiter. 
This was a fun assessment and I recieved some positive feedback from it.
